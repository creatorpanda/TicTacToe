# TicTacToe
SuperMario themed TicTacToe game made from scratch, based on JavaScript, tested only on Google Chrome.
Scoreboard, winner announcer and score reset button included! :)
enjoy!

(tiny update: created another page from scratch on Notepad++ where the main parts of the game's code are explained.)

In case you don't know what to do: Click on the green "Clone or Download" button, click "Download Zip". Unzip it, open "tictactoe.html" and have fun!
