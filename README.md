***Please note that this is an old project, served as an HTML/CSS tutorial. It no longer represents my current skills.***

SuperMario themed TicTacToe game **made from scratch, based on JavaScript**, **tested only on Google Chrome**.
Scoreboard, winner announcer and score reset button included! :)
enjoy!

*(tiny update: created another page from scratch on Notepad++ where the main parts of the game's code are explained.)*

In case you don't know what to do: Click on the green "Clone or Download" button, click "Download Zip". Unzip it, open "tictactoe.html" and have fun!
